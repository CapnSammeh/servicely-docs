Servicely provides support for both inbound and outbound Web-hooks.

## Outbound Webhooks

Outbound Webhooks can be configured to fire on application events. These
events can be used to send information to external systems.

Developers have complete control over the message format that is sent to
the external system.

## Inbound webhooks

Inbound webhooks can be configured to allow external systems to push
information into the platform.

Developers have complete control over the actions taken when the
messages are processed.
